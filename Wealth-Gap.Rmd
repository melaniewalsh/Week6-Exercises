## Homeownership

Here's a report about homeownership trends over time for different racial groups.

Each collaborator should make a different change -- convert to a line plot, add color, or hide the code.

```{r}
home_owner <- read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-02-09/home_owner.csv')


library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = home_owner) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = year, y = home_owner_pct))
```
